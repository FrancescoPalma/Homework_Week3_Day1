# *** Highly Recommended ***

Dear reader, I strongly recommend that you download - if you haven't already - [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) if you are a Mac user, or [MarkDownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) if you are a Windows user in order to read [this file](https://github.com/FrancescoPalma/Homework_Week3_Day1/blob/master/fringeshows_questions.md) for the sake of your sight.  
Why? For it looks like we're in front of a divergency of opinions between MacDown and Github... [[click here!](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads-eu.hipchat.com/407672/3408006/jfJ9fzlDyKbXitF/Screen%20Shot%202016-02-29%20at%2022.35.19.png)]
